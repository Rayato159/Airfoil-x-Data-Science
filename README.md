# Airfoil-x-Data-Science
This is my aerodynamics class work project.
I do this project with my group but my duty is about to find the best airfoils which conditions we need.
So I used machine learning which K means clustering model to divide in three group and used some statistics to find which airfoil is the best for our conditions.
Conditions: find the airfoil which less Cd at Re=4e6, Mach Number=0.3, Cl=0.5
